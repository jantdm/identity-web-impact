# Identity & the Web

This repository hosts discussions on the systemic impact of Identity  on the Web, based on [a write-up of the W3C Team current shared understanding](https://w3c.github.io/identity-web-impact/) of this space.

We invite the community to complete or correct that analysis by raising issues on the repository - please make sure these are focused on topics where the impact of AI systems can be qualified of systemic, and ideally, where a coordinated or standardized approach can have an effect.
